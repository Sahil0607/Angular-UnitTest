* Introduction 

--> Test only part which is written by me.
--> Do not test built in angular service and router.
--> Instead use fake service and fake Router to test our functionality.

* Integration test
--> Test component with external resources. Eg: file system, database, API endpoint.
--> If we write code in ts and test. But forget to bind function name with click button event so test will not work.
--> In angular world it means test component with its template.

Integration Test: Component + Template
Unit test:  Component Or Component + Fake Service.
End to end test: Entire app test.

* Test in action
--> Angular use ng test for test file. It will detect spec file and execute. 
--> We can see result two way. 
1. In Terminal 
2. In Browser
--> ng test --> Open browser --> debug --> Open console --> See all test and result.

describe() -  Write a suite which is group of related test. It has a list of test.
it() - to write a test(spec).
expect(): Write assert for test. expect() comes with Jasmin.
Ex: expect(result).toBe(0);

Ex: 
--> .ts file
export const count = (num) => {
  if (num > 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return 0;
};

--> .spec file
import { count } from './first-test.component';

describe('Count', () => {
  it('Should return 0 if num is 0', () => {
    const num = count(0);
    expect(num).toBe(0);
  });
  it('Should return 1 if num greater then 1', () => {
    const num = count(23);
    expect(num).toBe(1);
  });
});
